Reddit Karma Grabber
====================

If you or a loved one suffers from vast amounts of wasted time and obsession with a meaningless point system called Karma, this is your solution.

Instant Karma implements a unique algorithm to monitor and rank the newest posts on Reddit based on probability of success. We monitor hundreds of new posts for their change in "hotness," a metric used by Reddit's own ranking algorithm. Right now Reddit currently offers a way to filter posts by "new" and "rising," but both of these rankings drop posts after four to five minutes and most posts under both listings "die" quickly before ever getting more than one or two upvotes. Our analysis showed that only around ten percent of posts under "new" and "rising" ever get off the ground. Amateurs.

Our extended monitoring takes 100 new posts and narrows them down to the most promising ~25. During 15-30 minutes of real-time monitoring we prune the weakest posts from our list, filter in 100 new posts, and rank the top five to ten most promising posts. Because we extend monitoring past five minutes, none of our top ten have shown up in Reddit's "new" or "rising" rankings.

Math is cool and all, but we're in this for the Karma. Now that we have a unique list of the truly "hottest" posts, how can we milk these bad boys for all the Karma they're worth?

It turns out some Redditors out there are concerned with "reposts," people reusing old links, mostly images, to try to get Karma for their greedy selves. This website,  KarmaDecay, uses reverse image searching of Reddit to see what posts are reposts. It's meant prevent people from getting easy Karma. We're going to use it to do just that.

We reverse-image search our top ten posts to identify if any are reposts. If they are, we go back to the most popular identical previous posting of that image, steal the top ranked comment from that post, and post it ourselves under this new posting.

Combines an elegant algorithm more flexible than Reddit's own, and a dastardly application of this algorithm.

Say goodbye to wasted hours trying to find that special post and come up with that clever comment. Just sit back, relax, and let the code do the work. Instant Karma.
